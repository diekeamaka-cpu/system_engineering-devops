# 0x02-shell_redirections

This repository contains Bash scripts for practicing Linux shell redirections and basic file handling operations.

## Scripts

- Prints "Hello, World" followed by a new line.

- Displays a confused smiley: "(Ôo)'".

- Displays the content of `/etc/passwd`.

- Displays the content of both `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/hosts`.

- Displays the last 10 lines of `/etc/passwd`.

- Displays the first 10 lines of `/etc/passwd`.

- Displays the third line of the file `iacta` (without using `sed`).

- Creates a file named `*\"Best School"\*$\?*****:)` containing the text "Best School".

- Writes the output of `ls -la` into `ls_cwd_content`, overwriting the file if it already exists.

- Duplicates the last line of the file `iacta`.

- Deletes all regular files with a `.js` extension in the current directory and all subdirectories.
