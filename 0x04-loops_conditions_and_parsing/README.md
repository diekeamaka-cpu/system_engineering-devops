- If the file exists and is a regular file: displays `school is a regular file`
Add messages using a `case` statement:  
- 4 → “bad luck from China”  
- 9 → “bad luck from Japan”  
- 17 → “bad luck from Italy”  

### 6. For ls (8-for_ls)
List files in the current directory (non-hidden) using a `for` loop.  
Display only the part of the filename after the first dash (`-`), one per line.

### 7. To file, or not to file (9-to_file_or_not_to_file)
