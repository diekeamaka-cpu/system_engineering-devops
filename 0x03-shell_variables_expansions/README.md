# 0x03-shell_variables_expansions

Scripts to practice shell variables, environment variables, aliases, and arithmetic operations in Bash.


Create an alias `ls` with the value `rm *`.  
Example: after sourcing the script, executing `ls` will remove all files in the current directory.

Print `hello user`, where `user` is the current Linux user.  

Add `/action` to the `PATH` environment variable, ensuring it is the last directory in the search path.  

Count the number of directories listed in the `PATH` and print the total.  

List all environment variables currently set in the shell session.  

List all local variables, environment variables, and shell functions.  

Create a new local variable:  
- Name: `BEST`  
- Value: `School`  

Create a new global variable:  
- Name: `BEST`  
- Value: `School`  

Print the result of adding `128` to the value stored in the environment variable `TRUEKNOWLEDGE`.  

Print the result of dividing the environment variable `POWER` by `DIVIDE`.  

Print the result of `BREATH` raised to the power of `LOVE`.  

Make scripts executable with `chmod +x <script>` and run with `./<script>`.
